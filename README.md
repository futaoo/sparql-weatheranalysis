# Automated Climate Analyses Using Knowledge Graph
With the spirit of reproducible research, this repository includes a complete collection of codes required to generate the results and the diagrams presented in the paper:

## Instruction to Perform Climate Analysis with Our knowledge Graph
The process to get the results and pictures presented in the paper is separated into the two steps:
### Step 1&mdash;Obtaining the data using SPARQL queries
We exhibited two distinct types of weather analysis in the paper: 1) a comparison of daily average temperatures between Dublin (IE) and Manston (UK), and 2) a weather analysis of Sculthorpe (UK) in terms of numerous weather types. You may get weather data for those two cities by making the following two SPARQL queries to our [SPARQL endpoint](http://jresearch.ucd.ie/kg/dataset.html?tab=query&ds=/climate) :

For Dublin's and Manston's daily average temperature, use

```
BASE <http://jresearch.ucd.ie/climate-kg/>
PREFIX ca_prop: <http://jresearch.ucd.ie/climate-kg/ca/property/>
PREFIX sosa: <http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/>
PREFIX qudt: <http://qudt.org/1.1/schema/qudt#>

select ?tavg ?date
where {
  ?obs ca_prop:sourceStation <resource/station/GHCND:EI000003969> ; # switch the code to GHCND:UKE00105918 for Manston's temperature
       sosa:hasResult ?res ;
       sosa:resultTime ?date .
  ?res ca_prop:withDataType <resource/datatype/TAVG>;
       qudt:numericValue ?tavg.
  filter(year(?date)>1979 && year(?date)<2020)
} ORDER BY DESC(?date)
```

For Manston's weather type data, use

```
BASE <http://jresearch.ucd.ie/climate-kg/>
PREFIX ca_prop: <http://jresearch.ucd.ie/climate-kg/ca/property/>
PREFIX sosa: <http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/>
PREFIX qudt: <http://qudt.org/1.1/schema/qudt#>

select ?fog ?date
where{
  ?obs ca_prop:sourceStation <resource/station/GHCND:UKW00035036>;
       sosa:hasResult ?res ;
       sosa:resultTime ?date .
  ?res ca_prop:withDataType <resource/datatype/WT01>;
    qudt:numericValue ?fog.
  filter(year(?date)>1950 && year(?date)<1964).}
```
where we only provide the SPARQL query for weather type WT01, which is defined as "fog, ice fog, or freezing fog (may include dense fog)". The following table contains the entire set of codes for all weather types and their associated meanings that can be used to identify other weather types for Sculthorpe (UK).

DATA TYPE | DESCRIPTION
--- | ---
WT01 | Fog, ice fog, or freezing fog (may include heavy fog)
WT03 | Thunder
WT04 | Ice pellets, sleet, snow pellets, or small hail"
WT05 | Hail (may include small hail)
WT06 | Glaze or rime
WT08 | Smoke or haze
WT09 | Blowing or drifting snow
WT16 | Rain (may include freezing rain, drizzle, and freezing drizzle)
WT18 | Snow, snow pellets, snow grains, or ice crystals


The solutions of these queries should be identical to the pre-downloaded datasets `data/dublin.csv`, `data/manston.csv` and etc. in the `data` folder.

### Step 2&mdash;Weather Data Analysis through Python Notebook
See the in-line comments in the notebook `climate_analysis.ipynb`. The SPARQL query solutions as the raw data input and weather analyses snippets are indicated.
